# BattleShips Game

**BattleShips — Under Construction**

This repository will contain a simple Battleships game prototype. The project is currently **under construction** and the final gameplay specifics are still being decided. For now, a simple board component has been created to prototype the UI and basic game logic. Initial commit, needed to start from somewhere.

**Planned work**

- Decide turn mechanics
- Implement ship placement and hit detection
- Add **(potential)** multiplayer support
